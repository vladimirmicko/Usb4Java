Quick start

* Choose an API

  usb4java provides two different APIs you can choose from:

  * {{{./libusb.html}The low-level (libusb) API}}

  * {{{./javax-usb.html}The high-level (javax-usb) API}}

  []

  The low-level API closely follows the C API of the
  {{{http://libusb.info/}libusb}} project. This API has the advantage that it
  provides the same functionality as libusb does. And if you know the C API of
  libusb then you will most likely feel right at home when using this API
  with usb4java. It is also easy to convert existing C libusb programs into
  Java. The disadvantage is that you will have a hard time changing
  your code when you later switch to a different Java USB library. And as a
  pure Java developer you may dislike the API because it is too low-level (For
  example most methods return error codes instead of throwing exceptions).

  The high-level API simply implements the
  {{{http://javax-usb.sourceforge.net/}javax-usb (JSR80) API}}. One advantage
  of this API is that it is implementation-independent. So it is easy to
  switch to a different javax-usb implementation later without changing your
  code. Another advantage is that this API is object oriented and is much
  easier to use for Java developers. The disadvantage is that the javax-usb
  specification is very old (maybe even abandoned) and may lack support for
  some newer USB techniques provided by the low-level API.
