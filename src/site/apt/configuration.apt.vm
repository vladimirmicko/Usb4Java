Configuration

  The configuration options explained here are only valid for the javax-usb
  extension of usb4java. If you access your USB devices with the native
  libusb API then no configuration is needed.


* Selecting usb4java as javax-usb implementation

  To tell the USB Host Manager of <javax-usb> to use the <usb4java>
  implementation you have to put the following property into the
  <javax.usb.properties> file which must be located in the root of
  your classpath:

+----+
javax.usb.services = org.usb4java.javax.Services
+----+

  <usb4java> can be configured by adding more properties to this file as
  described in the following sections.


* Communication timeout

  The default USB communication timeout of <usb4java> is 2500 milliseconds.
  To change this to 250 milliseconds for example add this to the properties
  file:

+----+
org.usb4java.javax.timeout = 250
+----+


* Scan interval

  The default USB device scan interval of <usb4java> is 500 milliseconds. To
  change this to 1000 milliseconds for example add this to the properties file:

+----+
org.usb4java.javax.scanInterval = 1000
+----+

  When you set this interval to 0 then <usb4java> only scans once during
  application startup. If you want to trigger a manual device <scan> you can
  do it by calling the scan method on the USB services class (Must be casted
  to the <usb4java> implementation, because this is not a javax-usb feature:

+----+
((org.usb4java.javax.Services) UsbHostManager.getUsbServices()).scan();
+----+


* Use USBDK

  If you want to use {{{https://github.com/daynix/UsbDk}USBDK}} on Windows
  then you have to enable the feature with the following entry:

+----+
org.usb4java.javax.useUSBDK = true
+----+

  This setting is ignored on other platforms.
